# Getting to Know You

Welcome to DS217! Please take a few minutes to introduce yourself by answering these questions. There are no right or wrong answers - we just want to get to know you better and understand what you're hoping to get from this course.

## 1. Who are you and what's your background?
My name is Audrey Su, and I am a Master's student in Health Data Science at UCSF. Previously, I majored in Data Science at UC Berkeley. Interesting research that I previosuly participated in is I worked as Data Science Intern at Pfizer in order to improve the utility of the SEER Stat database by summarizing it into a more comprehensive dashboard, and I was an undergraduate resesearcher under Professor Neel Singhal at UCSF in order to associate the development of COVID-19 in patients admitted to the hospital with delirium. Currently, I am researching under Professor Erin Van Blarigan at UCSF on whether a text-message program can support colorectal cancer (CRC) survivors in choosing healthier foods in order to improve health outcomes. 

## 2. What are you looking for out of this class?
I hope to gain hands-on skills I can apply directly when doing health research that involves data science. 

I want concrete, career-ready skills I can apply in health data science and research. Specifically, I am interested in continuing to develop strong proficiencies in python in to improve my data analysis and machine learning skills. I also want to improve my skkills in data visualization and communication so I can effectively convey my insights to clinicians and stakeholders. My future career goals are to apply these skills to clinical research or industry roles in health data science. Hopefully this class can help me develop essential competencies for my aspirations. 

## 3. What are you most looking forward to or tentative about?
What excites me most about programming/data science is it allows me to transform raw, unstructured data into valuable insights. I enjoy the analytical challenge of coding—breaking complex problems into smaller, manageable steps and building effective solutions. I do have some concerns about messy real-world data, such as missing values, inconsistencies, and bias, and I want to get better at choosing the right approaches for these situations. I'm also concerned about being able to create code that is well-structured, optimized, and easy to maintain. I’m also learning that good programming isn’t just about making code work—it’s about writing code that is clear, efficient, and maintainable.

## 4. Share something you enjoy!
I'm having tons of fun reading this book called *Bill Marriott: Success Is Never Final* by Dale Van Atta.
